# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

__*Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection*__

* Paste the following code at the end of the link: 
```
%27%20OR%20SLEEP(5)=0--%27
```
The site will sleep for 5 seconds before responding.

__*Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking*__

* Both use the same PHPSESSID.

## Green

__*Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration*__

* Valid username message appears in bold text, while non-valid username appears in non-bold text.
